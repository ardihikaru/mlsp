# Wine reduction using PCA

The best way to visualize unsupervised dataset is by using the PCA algorithm. Here I've tested PCA on famouse Wine dataset.

## Dataset

Dataset used in this mini project can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).

## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 1.2.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 1.5.1
> *  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.17.1

## Code

The code used in this project is inside **reduction_using_pca.ipynb**.
The optional part of this project is to use custom numpy version of the PCA. In the case you want to learn how to write it or test it on your dataset you will find in the file **pca_numpy.py**.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

`ipython notebook reduction_using_pca.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook reduction_using_pca.ipynb`
